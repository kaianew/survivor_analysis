# survivor_analysis
A network analysis of data from the TV show Survivor.

This analysis uses the <a href="https://github.com/doehm/survivoR">survivoR</a> dataset, so make sure you have that if you're trying to run anything.

The main bridging vs. bonding analysis is done in survivor_analysis.Rmd, and other basic network metrics are in the Jupyter notebook because I got fed up with trying to work with NetworkX through R.
